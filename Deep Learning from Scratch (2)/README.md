# Deep Learning from Scratch (2) - Practice with RNNs and NLP

This directory contains my code implementations and notes based on **"Deep Learning from Scratch 2"** by Goki Saito.  
The focus of this book is on **recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and natural language processing (NLP)**, and all implementations are done from scratch with NumPy and Python.

## 💡 What I Learned (highlights)
- Recap of neural network fundamentals required for sequence models.  
- Word embedding concepts and practical implementation of **word2vec** (CBOW / Skip-gram).  
- Techniques to speed up embedding training (negative sampling, hierarchical softmax ideas covered).  
- Building and training **RNNs**, and why gated variants (LSTM/GRU) are necessary to mitigate vanishing gradients.  
- Using RNNs for generative tasks (simple text generation).  
- Introduction to **attention** and how it improves sequence modelling (foundation for seq2seq/transformer ideas).
