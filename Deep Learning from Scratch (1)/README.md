# Deep Learning from Scratch (1) - Fundamentals of Neural Networks

This directory contains my code implementations and notes based on "Deep Learning from Scratch 1" by Goki Saito. The focus of this book is to build **fundamental deep learning models from scratch** using only NumPy, without relying on frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
